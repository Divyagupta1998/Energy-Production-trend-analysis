Energy Consumption and Revenue Insights
Overview
This project examines energy consumption and revenue trends across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. The primary objectives are to:

Analyze how peak energy demand influences revenue.
Identify seasonal variations in energy consumption.
Detect key revenue patterns across different customer groups.
The study involves exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling using linear regression and KMeans clustering. The insights derived aim to support strategic planning and operational improvements in the energy sector.

Exploratory Analysis and Visualization
Leveraging visual tools like box plots to detect anomalies.
Assessing relationships between critical variables.
Predictive Modeling and Analysis
Revenue Impact of Peak Energy Demand: Implemented linear regression to evaluate how peak consumption affects revenue generation.
Seasonal Consumption Trends: Utilized KMeans clustering to distinguish energy usage variations between summer and winter.
Revenue Segmentation by Customer Type: Applied KMeans clustering to identify unique revenue behaviors among different customer categories.
Key Takeaways
The findings emphasize the importance of managing peak demand efficiently to maximize financial returns. Additionally, they highlight the benefits of tailored energy strategies, particularly in the residential sector, where energy efficiency programs can lead to significant cost savings.
